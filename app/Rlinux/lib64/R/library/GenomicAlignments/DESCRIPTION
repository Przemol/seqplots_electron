Package: GenomicAlignments
Title: Representation and manipulation of short genomic alignments
Description: Provides efficient containers for storing and manipulating
	short genomic alignments (typically obtained by aligning short reads
	to a reference genome). This includes read counting, computing the
	coverage, junction detection, and working with the nucleotide content
	of the alignments.
